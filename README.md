# What is crshell?
A minimal shell built with Crust, using raw pointers, zero external dependencies, and a custom stdlib. It supports basic command execution and is designed for those who want to understand shell internals at a low level. History and Lua-based plugin support are on the roadmap.

# Why I used Crust:
Because using no_std for a shell sounded like a great idea at 3 AM.
